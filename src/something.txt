The release timings for the upcoming chapter are listed below, along with the corresponding time zones:
As observed in earlier chapters of Dandadan, Kinta Sakata is by far one of the most highly skilled characters in the series. He is the only individual who can easily maneuver the Mecha Buddha construct. Momo’s house, which is entirely made up of nano skin, requires formidable imagination skills to reconstruct the place into anything possible.

Kinta has frequently proven that no one can beat him in controlling the Mecha Buddha, as it only works with precisely visualized movements. In a recent chapter, Kinta discovered that, even in the absence of Ayase’s residence, he could rely on the torii gate by turning it into a hyperbike. Dandadan chapter 100 will see more abilities of Kinta’s bike besides its blinding speed.
